## Getting started

### Requirements

- Go 1.4+

### Install

1. Install using `go get -u github.com/jdextraze/go-gesclient`.
2. Install [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) with `go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor`.
3. Install vendor packages with `govendor sync`

### Optional Tools

* [Robo](https://github.com/tj/robo) (`go get github.com/tj/robo`)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

### Running EventStore on local machine

See https://developers.eventstore.com/server/5.0.9/server/installation/

### Running EventStore with docker

`docker run --rm --name eventstore -d -p 1113:1113 -p 2113:2113 eventstore/eventstore:release-5.0.8`

or if you installed robo

* Start a node: `robo start_es 5.0.8`
* Start a node with SSL: `robo start_es 5.0.8 ssl`
* Stop the node: `robo stop_es`
* Start a cluster: `robo start_es_cluster 5.0.8`
* Stop the cluster: `robo stop_es_cluster`

### Examples

For examples, look into the `examples` folder. All examples connect to `tcp://localhost:1113` by default.

#### Building

To build all examples, use `robo build`.

#### Using SSL

To use SSL in examples, add `-ssl-host localhost -ssl-skip-verify` to the command line.

You can also add the example certificates to your local store by running `robo install_certificate`.
Then you don't need to add `-ssl-skip-verify`.
